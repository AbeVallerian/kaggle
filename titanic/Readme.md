Well, I believe this project is the starting point for all kagglers.

In this notebook, I built Logistic Regression model using Tensorflow. Yes, I know it's quite overkill. Using other libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, is much faster and easier. However, I just started learning Tensorflow recently and this is a great project to start building model in Tensorflow.

Enjoy! Your feedback is very welcomed :)
